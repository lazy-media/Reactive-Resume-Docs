## Ensuring Your Privacy with Reactive Resume Email Communications

The email address associated with the public/free version of Reactive Resume (`owner@lazymedia.media`) is used **solely** for sending verification emails and password reset requests. Privacy is our top priority, which is why we have implemented an automated email filter to immediately delete messages from the `rxresume.org` domain after they are sent.

**Key Points:**

* Neither the owner of Reactive Resume nor the email administrator will have access to your tokens or other sensitive information.
* All emails from `rxresume.org` are automatically purged after delivery.
