# ðŸŽ´ Mission

The mission of Reactive Resume is clear and simple.

> * to make resumes accessible to everyone, for free, forever.
> * to make the process of designing a resume hassle-free.
> * to prove that free doesn't always have to mean low quality.

Reactive Resume, since its inception, has never has implemented any sort of user tracking, telemetry, advertising or paywalls, and I hope to keep it that way for as long as I can support the project.

I do, however, accept donations as a means of sustaining the development of the project, so if you feel like you'd want to extend your support and lend a hand, read more here:
