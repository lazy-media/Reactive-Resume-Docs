# ðŸ›‘ Alternate AI Integration Guide

### Supported AI Models and Services

Reactive Resume is designed to work seamlessly with AI services that implement the standard OpenAI API interface. This includes both local AI deployments and cloud-based services that follow the OpenAI API specification.

### Compatibility Requirements

For optimal performance, your AI service must support:

* OpenAI-style API endpoints (`/v1/chat/completions`)
* Standard API key authentication format (`sk-****`)
* Identical request/response structure as OpenAI's API

### Recommended Setup Options

#### Option 1: Local AI Deployment (Recommended)

* **Ollama** with OpenWebUI interface

#### Option 2: Cloud Services

* **OpenAI ChatGPT** (direct integration)
* **Azure OpenAI Services**
* Any service providing full OpenAI API compatibility

### Important Notice: Unsupported Configurations

#### Incompatible Services

Services such as **Perplexity AI**, **Claude API**, and other providers that do not implement the exact OpenAI API specification will result in errors including:

* `Error 400: Bad Request`
* `Error 405: Method Not Allowed`
* Authentication failures
* Response parsing errors

#### Critical: Avoid "Thinking" Models

**We highly recommend against using "thinking" AI models** such as DeepSeek's thinking models or any AI that employs extended processing chains before responding. These models:

1. **Break expected response patterns** that Reactive Resume relies on
2. **Cause timeouts and processing errors** due to extended response times
3. **Provide unstructured responses** that cannot be properly parsed
4. **Interfere with the standard request-response flow** essential for resume generation

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter errors when using AI features:

1. **Verify your endpoint** matches the OpenAI API structure exactly
2. **Confirm API key format** uses the `sk-` prefix
3. **Test with standard OpenAI** first to establish baseline functionality
4. **Check that your local AI deployment** (Ollama, etc.) is properly configured with OpenWebUI or equivalent OpenAI-compatible interface

### Need Help?

For additional support with AI integration, please consult:

* OpenWebUI documentation for local setup
* Ollama's OpenAI compatibility guide
* Reactive Resume's AI integration documentation

Remember: Successful AI integration requires exact compliance with the OpenAI API specification. Alternative implementations will not function correctly with Reactive Resume.

**Note:** Reactive Resume is built around the OpenAI API standard. If you have experience integrating other AI services and can implement support without significant code changes, we welcome your contribution.
