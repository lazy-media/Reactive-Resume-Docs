However, it is quite simple to create multi-page resumes and only requires a tiny bit of manual effort.

When you click on the "Add New Page" button, it creates a new row with "Main" and "Sidebar" columns. Simply drag-and-drop the sections you want to see in the new page from the first page to the second one.
