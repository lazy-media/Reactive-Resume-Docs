# üì¢ Making your resume publicly available

By default, all the resumes created on Reactive Resume are set to private. This means that only you can see and download them. However, if you wish, you can make them publicly visible. There are some benefits to doing so, which we will discuss in this guide.

### Solving the problem of stale resumes

When you export a resume as a PDF, you are essentially creating a static version of the resume at the time of export. Although this may be acceptable in certain situations, many companies retain your information for extended periods to reach out to you in the future when relevant job openings arise. By that point, your old resume could be outdated, as you may have acquired new work experiences or developed new skills over time.

To circumvent this problem, you can make your resume publicly available through a link. This ensures that when a recruiter visits the link, they will always see the most up-to-date information. Additionally, they will have the option to easily download your resume as a PDF if needed, for internal sharing purposes.

### Tracking resumes views and downloads

One of the main concerns that arises when sending out resumes is whether companies actually review them immediately after they are sent. In the past, there have been various methods to discreetly track this information. One example is by adding a small, invisible pixel to your resume that would notify the sender when the resume is opened. However, many PDF readers have become smarter in detecting and blocking images or scripts from running on the recipient‚Äôs computer.

When you share your publicly visible resumes link to others, you can track how many people have seen it, or how many people have downloaded the resume from the page.

### You are not restricted to a page

Nowadays, it is uncommon to print resumes, so there is no longer a strict requirement to follow the A4 or Letter page format standards. As a result, Reactive Resume does not automatically move your content to a new page if it exceeds the page break limit. Additionally, when you export your resume as a PDF, it generates a page that adjusts to the length of the resume content. This ensures that the resume remains easily readable on all popular PDF viewers.

As an added bonus, when you make your resume publicly available, it is displayed on a webpage that expands to fit your content, eliminating the concept of traditional pages and presenting your resume more like a personal website on a single page.

### It looks cool! ‚ùÑÔ∏è

A public resume gets its own URL and its own place on the internet forever. When someone visits the link, they see nothing but your resume (and a small link to Reactive Resume). It is designed in a way that puts your content in the spotlight and makes your resume visually more appealing than if it were viewed on a regular PDF reader.

### So, how do you make a resume public? It‚Äôs simple.

Head on over to the resume builder screen of the resume you want to make public. Scroll down to the "Sharing" section in the right-hand side panel and toggle the switch that says "Public", and that‚Äôs it!

You can now copy a link to your resume that can be shared with others. If you think the link is too long, use any link shortening service (like [bit.ly](http://bit.ly) or [kutt.it](http://kutt.it)) to shorten your link and personalise it with a unique URL.
