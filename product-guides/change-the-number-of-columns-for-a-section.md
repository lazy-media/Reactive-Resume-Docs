# üîÑ Change the number of columns for a section

In Reactive Resume, users have the option to either keep their resume sections listed one below the other for a single column layout, or they can choose a multi-column section to accommodate more information in a single row or page.

This works especially well if you need to include a larger number of social profiles, skills, or interests in a single row. However, it is not limited to any specific section.

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) and resume parsers currently favor single-column resumes with a straightforward one-item-per-row format for optimal performance.

Yet, the landscape is poised for change as Artificial Intelligence evolves. Modern AI models, like GPTs, are now capable of quickly parsing and extracting key information from resumes, regardless of their layout or formatting, making them more versatile and efficient in handling various resume styles.

To adjust the column count for a section in your resume, navigate to the resume builder page and scroll to the section you wish to modify. Here in the example below, we have a resume using the "Bronzor" template showcasing four skills; you might notice they occupy a considerable amount of space.

<div data-full-width="true">

</div>

Click on the menu icon next to the section title and hover over the ‚ÄúColumns‚Äù sub-menu. Here, you can choose between 1 to 5 columns for your section.

Let‚Äôs switch it to 4 columns, since we have 4 skills to display in a row.

That looks much better, and that‚Äôs how you change the number of columns for a specific section.
